# NCR Token Investigation Summary

## Quick Facts
- **Token**: Neos Credits (NCR)
- **Platform**: NeosVR (Virtual Reality Platform) 
- **Blockchain**: Polygon
- **Contract**: 0x0cbC9b02B8628AE08688b5cC8134dc09e36C443b
- **Investigation Period**: October 2021 - October 2022

## Current Status (as of investigation)
- **Price**: ~$0.017 (down ~99% from ATH)
- **Liquidity**: <$2 across all DEXs
- **Trading**: Minimal to no volume
- **Project**: Appears abandoned

## Key Findings

### 1. Trading Pairs Found
- SushiSwap pairs with extremely low liquidity (<$2)
- No significant liquidity on major Polygon DEXs
- Trading volume effectively zero

### 2. Timeline Analysis
- **Oct-Nov 2021**: Launch and rapid price increase (metaverse hype)
- **Nov 2021**: Peak reached during crypto/metaverse boom
- **Dec 2021 - Mar 2022**: Steady decline begins
- **Apr - Jul 2022**: Accelerated collapse
- **Aug - Oct 2022**: Token becomes worthless

### 3. Red Flags Identified
1. **Liquidity Disappearance**: Need to verify when/how liquidity was removed
2. **Project Abandonment**: NeosVR appears to have ceased meaningful development
3. **Communication Breakdown**: Team likely went silent during decline
4. **Token Utility**: Promised use cases apparently never materialized

## Investigation Requirements

### High Priority
1. **Wallet Analysis**
   - Identify team/developer wallets
   - Track large transfers during decline
   - Check for coordinated dumping

2. **Liquidity History**
   - When was liquidity added/removed?
   - Who controlled LP tokens?
   - Were there rug-like removals?

3. **Team Activity**
   - Last official communications
   - GitHub commit history
   - Social media activity timeline

### Tools for Further Investigation
1. **PolygonScan**: Full transaction history
2. **Bubble Maps**: Wallet connection analysis
3. **Archive.org**: Historical website/social media
4. **DexScreener**: Historical chart data

## Preliminary Conclusion

NCR appears to be a failed project that may have involved some level of exit scamming, though distinguishing between:
- Intentional rugpull
- Project failure with poor communication
- Team incompetence/abandonment

...requires deeper on-chain analysis and historical context from community sources.

## Next Steps
1. Manual review of PolygonScan data
2. Community member interviews (Reddit/Discord)
3. Wallet clustering analysis
4. Liquidity event timeline construction
